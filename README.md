Generation Z, often abbreviated as Gen Z, is the generation that comes after Millennials (also known as Gen Y) and includes individuals born between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s, although the exact years vary depending on the source. This means that in 2023, the oldest members of Gen Z are in their late 20s, while the youngest are still in early childhood.
Gen Z is sometimes also referred to as the Information Generation, Post-Millennials, or home landers, among other names. This generation is known for growing up in a world shaped by digital technology, social media, and globalization. They are often described as being more diverse, tolerant, and socially aware than previous generations, and more likely to value individualism and entrepreneurship.
